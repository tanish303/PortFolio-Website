  "bio": {
    "longBio": "I started coding through YouTube tutorials, slowly improving by building projects and gaining real experience from internships. I'm an introvert, an overthinker, highly logical, sometimes lame with jokes, very selective, and perfection-driven. Anxiety has been with me since childhood, but I keep moving because staying idle makes things worse. I'm a mix of depressive, narcissistic, self-hating yet extremely potential-driven. Video games, friends, and sleep are my coping mechanisms. I value perfection in my work and believe in learning through doing, not by theory. My personality is quiet but sharp, and I approach problems by eliminating the wrong paths until only the best solution remains."
